	<h3>Hi! Thanks for using Journalist's toolbox.</h3>
    <p>This extension is designed to make life easier for reporters. Here's what it does:</p>

    <h5>Search competitors' sites</h5>
	<p>Finding stories your competitors have written can be a pain without access to their archives. The extension stores up to five competitor sites for you, letting you run a custom Google search <em>just on those sites</em> at any time.</p>
    <p>To use the site search feature, click on the extension icon in the top-right corner of your browser, then click "Options." Add in your sites, then click save. Then just enter your search term(s) into the text field and click enter.</p>
	<p>GIF</p>
	<p>You can change the competitor sites you want to search at any time.</p>

	<h5>Quick dictionary + thesaurus</h5>
	<p>I can't even begin to count the number of times I opened up thesaurus.com when I worked as a reporter. With this extension, you don't have to. Enter your search term and click "Definitions" or "Synonyms." That's it.</p>

	<h5>Social media shortcuts</h5>
	<p>This extension binds a few new keyboard shortcuts to Chrome. Press Alt+T to open Twitter, Alt+B for Facebook and Alt+G for Gmail.</p>

	<h5>Thank you</h5>
	<p>Reporters are the most important people on the planet, and I hope this extension makes your life a little easier. If you run into any bugs, please <a href="mailto:kfarhang0@gmail.com" title="Email Kia Farhang">email me</a> so I can fix them. You can also <a href="https://paypal.me/KiaFarhang/3" title="Donate to Kia Farhang" title="_blank">make a small donation</a> if you're so inclined. I'll never do a pledge drive.</p>
